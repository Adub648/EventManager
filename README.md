# Event Manager

A program created for The Odin Project curriculum in Ruby.

This program takes a set of data of registrations for an event, interacts with the Google CivicInfoV2 API to determine the local representatives of their zip code and then outputs sample thank you emails.

It also will format phone numbers to be shown in the console, as well as calculating the most popular hour and weekday for registrations, and displaying how many times users have registered in these time periods in the console.
